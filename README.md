# IMDB-MovieDataSet-Analysis

The data set is taken from "https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata"

The project aims to decipher factors that contribute to "Success of Movies". 

The project has
1) A presentation which talks about Success Criteria (I concentrate on Commercial Success and Critical Acclimation) which lists the project in detail
2) An R file for Data Cleaning and Model Building
3) The model is built using Logistic Regression because we need interpretability
